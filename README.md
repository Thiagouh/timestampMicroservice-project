# Timestamp Microservice

This project is a clone of the [Timestamp Microservice](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) from FreeCodeCamp, with some improvements and custom features added.

## Usage

Here is an API that can convert a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format to a Unix timestamp and UTC date. You can test it by going to `/api/:date`.
